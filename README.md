Yet another IntelliJ IDEA zenburn theme with support for Kotlin.

Originally by @zajac with slight modifications by @matklad.

Usage: put zenburn.icls into `config/colors` directory inside IDEA home directory.
Here's how it looks on my machine: `~/.IdeaIC2017.1/config/colors/zenburn.icls`.

The .icls file is just XML, you can edit it with any text editor.
